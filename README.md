## Topic -- LoanDelinquency
Home Credit Group is an international consumer finance provider with operations in 10 countries. It focuses on responsible lending primarily to people with little or no credit history. 
Since the business model of Home Credit Group mainly focuses on unbanked population, it has no way to determine if a person is likely to repay the loan since itâ€™s traditionally done using a metric like Credit Score etc. 

Our project intends to use their data and predicts using statistics and machine learning how likely a potential borrower is to repay back the loan and identify potential defrauders.
